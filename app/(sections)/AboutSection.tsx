            Hey! Thanks for scrolling this far :) I graduated from
            Monash University with a double bachelor of computer science üñ•Ô∏è and
            finance üí∏. I've also completed a full-stack bootcamp with a great
            open-source community (you might've heard of it) The Odin Project.
          </p>

            Other than coding and tech, I'm also interested in the world of
            finance, continuously trying to improve my financial literacy with a
            sprinkle of accounting along the way.
          </p>

            In my down time, I am trying to pick up some relaxing hobbies.
            Currently, I'm into books and baking. Although I do want to pick up
            an artsy/crafty hobby. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any
            suggestions!
